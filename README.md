# MemeMe2.0

This is my rendition of the MemeMe 2.0 project for the iOS Developer nanodegree at [udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com). Meme 2.0 is the last project for the course UIKit Fundamentals.

This project extends MemeMe 1.0 by showing sent memes in a tab view with a table view tab and a collection view tab.
